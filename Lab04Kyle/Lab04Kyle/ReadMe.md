I did struggle with this project a little but mainly because of my naming convention.
I was having a hard time with my correlation of the derived classes to the base. Because of
that I struggled with coming up with properties and methods to create to show inheritance.
It took me probably 5 hours total actual time to code, but after I overcame my obstacle and renamed
my base it went smoothly from there.  I used Docs, tutorials, peers, and my Instructor as resources
to finish the project.
